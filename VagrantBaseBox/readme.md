## software stack
There are lots of great projects about automating the deployment of a lab environment. One of the easiest ways in terms of software and monetary requirements is the route via:
- Vagrant
- Ansible
- Virtualbox
and some Windows test versions.

The only thing needed for this setup is any kind of x64 system. While terraform and cloud hosters are cool this tech stack allows easy experimentation.
